This zipfile contains two items, probably interesting to different
groups of people:

For C++ programmers of OS/2:

Included is a simple but functional set of control classes for handling
spin buttons, radio buttons, entry fields, listboxes, comboboxes, and
sliders.  Not everything you might want is here, but enough for simple
applications.  Please use them freely, and modify them at will.  If
you make any substantial improvements, I'd like a copy for my own use.
Who knows -- perhaps this can grow into something truly useful to many
programmers.  They all seem to work fine under gcc/2 2.5.4
Also, the complete application (described below) has PM graphics, and
printer support.  All comes with full source, which is hereby placed in
the Public Domain.



For Woodworkers with OS/2:

A simple dovetail design program (using the above control libraries) is
included.  It allows for some flexibility in spacing the pins/tails, and
will print a template from which you can copy the design to your project.
I wrote this for my own use in hand cutting dovetails and find it quite
useful.

It works fine on my HP Laserjet printer.  It SHOULD work on whatever
the default printer is on your system.  If not, please let me know and
I might try to fix it.  Currently it is limited (when printing) to
print at most a 10" long design (since that will fit on one page).  If
there is much interest in printing longer designs, I can make it print
in halves up to 20 inches.  I won't until I need it, or enough of you
tell me you'd like it.

To install, just unzip this file (which you no doubt have done).  To
run the program you only need dove.exe -- you can discard the rest.
Then run it.  It will create a file "dovetail.dat" in your current directory
and store your designs in there.

Please use these and distribute this program/source code freely.
